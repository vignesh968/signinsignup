These programs can be asked from control statements, array, string, oops etc. Java basic programs like fibonacci series, prime numbers, factorial numbers and palindrome numbers are frequently asked in the interviews and exams. All these programs are given with the maximum examples and output. If you are new to Java programming, we will recommend you to read our Java tutorial first. Let's see the list of Java programs.
